## Abstract
Today's car wipers work on the principle of manual switching. The traditional wiper system requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. This does not only require driver’s attention, but also, causes a certain level of discomfort to the driver and serves as a source of distraction which increases the risk of accidents. To offer comfort to the driver and essentially reduce the risk of accidents, an automatic rain sensing device has become a necessity, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. Automatic rain sensing wiper system detects rain and starts automatically and stops when the rain stops. 
## Working
In this project assume that the automobile as the microcontroller and the wiper system is represented by a series of glowing LED's.
The RED LED is considered for the ACC position.
Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED glows continuously until the engine stops, indicating the engine condition to be turned ON. The other three BLUE, GREEN, and ORANGE LED's come on one at a time with the set frequency.
The frequency changes with each alternate key press, and there are three frequency levels (1,4,8 Hz).
The LED glow pattern ends on the fourth press, and the wiper action begins with the next press. If the push button is held down for 2 seconds, the RED LED turns OFF and the pattern ends, returning it to its default position, indicating that the engine has been shut OFF.
