## Requirements
### Introduction
Today's car wipers work on the principle of manual switching. The traditional wiper system requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. This does not only require driver’s attention, but also, causes a certain level of discomfort to the driver and serves as a source of distraction which increases the risk of accidents. To offer comfort to the driver and essentially reduce the risk of accidents, an automatic rain sensing device has become a necessity, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel. Automatic rain sensing wiper system detects rain and starts automatically and stops when the rain stops. 

### SWOT Analysis
#### Strengths
1.	Hands-Free Calling.
2.	Automatically detects rain and wipes the windows by moving the wiper.
3.	Improve safety by decreasing driver distraction.
#### Weakness
1.	The rain sensor-based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
2.	Additional cost is required in case optical sensor is used.
#### Opportunities
1.	Safety 
2.	Hands-free calling
#### Threats
1.	It is replaced by an advanced technology
2.	Rubber blades, wiper motor can create a problem

### 4W's & 1H
#### What
It is an automatic rain sensing wiper system that detects rain and starts automatically and stops when the rain stops. 
#### Why
For cleaning the rain drops fallen on windshield of the vehicle 
#### When
During rains
#### Who
Gives clear visibility to the driver during rains 
#### How
Once the rain droplets fall on the windshield of the vehicle
